# Web Copy — Module 01: Boot the Dojo

## Hero Section
- **Title:** “Boot the Dojo”
- **Subtitle:** “Prove your machine can mentor you. Install the CLI, run the rituals, and write the first field note of your mastery journey.”
- **CTA:** `Start Module 01` (primary), `Read the Origin Story` (secondary link to section below).

## Origin Story (Presentation Copy)
> I kept shipping apps without really knowing what happened after I pressed enter. So I built a CLI that would hold me accountable. No dashboards, no shortcuts—just a terminal asking hard questions until I could answer them. “Boot the Dojo” is the moment I invite you into that process. We suit up our shells together, compare diagnostics, and write down what we learn so future-us doesn’t forget.

- **Tone cues:** humble, honest, referencing `docs/brand.md` “mentor-learner” stance.
- **Visual prompt:** monochrome photo/illustration of a terminal desk; overlay command `learning % run doctor`.

## Section: Why Start Here?
- Copy:  
  > Modern backend work still begins in the shell. Before repos, before frameworks, there’s the question: does your environment deserve your trust? Module 01 slows you down long enough to answer that honestly.
- Bullets:  
  - Run the same diagnostics operators use.  
  - Catch gaps in Docker/Git/Node before they bite you mid-lesson.  
  - Learn to explain every line of output like you’re teaching a teammate.

## Lesson Cards (for web UI)
1. **Terminal Mindset** — “Make the shell your home base.”  
2. **Device Auth Ritual** — “Handshake between your machine and the dojo.”  
3. **Diagnostics & Puzzles** — “Fix reality, not screenshots.”  
4. **Field Notes** — “Teach it back, cement the lesson.”

Each card links to the lesson detail page sourced from `lessons.md`.

## Assignment Preview Copy
- **Install & Authenticate:** “A lightweight installer plus a device-code flow that surfaces every scope and detail. Nothing hidden.”
- **Doctor Run:** “Verbose diagnostics streamed via Mercure; fix issues, rerun, log what you learned.”
- **Command Puzzle:** “A tiny log-parsing quest reminding you that pipes and scripts are still the backbone of backend work.”
- **Reflection:** “Write the post-mortem before the next module. Your words become part of the dashboard narrative.”

## Proof & Social
- Suggested quote (placeholder until real learner quotes exist):  
  > “I thought I knew my setup. Then the dojo asked questions I didn’t have answers to—and helped me find them.”

## Post-Module CTA
- Primary: `Move to Module 02 – Runtime X-Ray` (disabled until completion).  
- Secondary: `Publish your Field Note` (links to reflection editing UI).
