# Module 01 — Boot the Dojo (Shell & Environment Lab)

This opening module sets the stage for the entire CLI-first mastery journey. Learners outfit their workstation, prove their environment can be coached, and internalize why the terminal is the primary interface for the program. It mirrors the “Act I – Boot the Dojo” beat from `docs/curriculum-manifest.md`. Course/Lesson/Assignment records now live in Postgres via the EasyAdmin dashboard (`/admin`), so updates here must also be reflected through the admin UI before shipping.

## Narrative Snapshot
- **Why now?** Before chasing deeper runtime or systems insight, the platform needs to trust the learner’s machine. The story is about earning that trust by demonstrating discipline with the shell.
- **Who’s speaking?** The founder/learner (“me”) narrates the process: “I want to master the craft, so I’m making my terminal my mentor.”
- **Emotional arc:** from uncertainty (“Is my setup good enough?”) to grounded confidence (“I know what every diagnostic line means”).

## Learning Outcomes
1. Install and authenticate the CLI via device-code flow without hand-holding.  
2. Run the `doctor` suite, interpret each probe, and log remediation steps.  
3. Execute command puzzles that exercise navigation, pipes, permissions, and scripting basics.  
4. Capture reflections that explain what the machine actually did and why it matters.

## Module Structure
| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Lessons (`lessons.md`) | Web copy + video beats for each lesson (Terminal Mindset, Device Auth, Diagnostics, Reflection). |
| Assignments (`assignments.md`) | CLI task specs: `BOOT-CLI-001` (install/auth), `BOOT-CLI-002` (doctor), `BOOT-CLI-003` (command puzzle), `BOOT-CLI-004` (reflection log). |
| Web Copy (`web-copy.md`) | Course page narrative, origin-story snippet, CTA copy. |
| Assets (`assets/`) | Placeholder for screenshots, transcripts, diagrams (empty `.gitkeep` currently). |

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with command-line navigation.  
- macOS or Linux workstation with Docker, Git, Node ≥18 installed (validated by the module).  
- Willingness to document remediation steps publicly (journal/CLI reflection).

## Completion Signals
- CLI telemetry shows all assignments passed and reflections submitted.  
- Web dashboard displays the module badge “Boot the Dojo.”  
- Learner publishes an “Environment Field Note” summarizing fixes and insights (referenced in `web-copy.md`).
